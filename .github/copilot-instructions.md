Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code.

We do not use `try...catch`.

We use `.then()` when first fetching data from an API, and switch to `async/await` when instructed.

We use `const` and `let` for variables and template literals for string formatting and DOM insertion.
